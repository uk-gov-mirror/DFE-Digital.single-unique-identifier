# Notifications (Webhooks): Requirements and High-Level Design

**Date:** `2026-06-04`  
**Owner:** SUI Service Team  

> **Status: proposed, not implemented.** This document explores webhook functionality for the earlier distributed discovery architecture. Get an Identifier does not currently register or dispatch webhooks, and the behaviours below must not be read as an as-built description.

The current supplier lifecycle notification contract is documented separately:

- [Supplier lifecycle webhook contract v1](./SupplierLifecycle/V1/Index.md)

That contract covers notifications triggered by NHS number and registered GP changes. It does not make the older job and search notification design on this page current.

This document outlines the key requirements, technical guidelines, and high-level design for adding Notifications to the SUI system.


## Goals

The goals and reasons for adding Notifications to the SUI system are:

* Relive the pressure that polling will put on the system.
* Ability for some number of search (find-record) results to be provided more quickly.


## Requirements

1. (Must have) Custodians should be able to be notified when they have Jobs, rather than having to poll for Jobs.
2. (Should have) Searchers should be able to be notified when their Search Request completes, rather than having to poll for Search Request completion.
    * Note that as this design has evolved, the most likely option to provide the best value will be to notify the Searchers about any significant status updates/changes.


## Technical Guidelines / Decisions

* Notifications will be implemented as **Webhooks**.
* The solution must **build upon Jobs**, so that:
  - There is a single mechanism for Custodians to submit results.
  - We reuse as much of the existing Work Items / Jobs / 'record discovery' implementation as possible to reduce implementation and maintenance effort.
* Security: Subscribers need to know it's actually us calling them and not a malicious actor.
  - We should use the industry standard for this which is **HMAC** (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).
  - At least **SHA256** should be used for the HMAC.
* Two subscriptions should be offered (to enable organisations to opt-in incrementally, and so that Custodian and Searcher contexts are kept separate):
  1. `Job Created` subscription
  2. `Search Updated` subscription
* Notifications should avoid introducing new infrastructure technologies at this point (e.g. avoid introducing Azure Service Bus or Event Grid), so there are no architectural changes to the infrastructure stack.
* Subscribing to Webhooks should be **optional**, so that Polling is still offered as the baseline integration.

## High-Level Design

  orgDir["`Subscription Management

  jobCreated["Job Created"]
  searchUpdated["Search Updated"]
  custodians["Custodians"]
  searchers["Searchers"]

  orgDir --> sui

  sui --> jobCreated --> custodians

  sui --> searchUpdated --> searchers
```

### Subscription Management
* Org Directory will need an optional ability for webhook URLs to be supplied (eventually the Custodians will supply these to us).
* Org Directory will need a private secret key per Custodian that we use to sign webhook payloads (HMAC), so that Custodians can verify it is us that called them (payload is authentic), and that the payload hasn't been tampered.

### Dispatching Notifications
* Dispatching should use message queues, so that:
  * the notification functionality doesn't block the main functionality, and
  * we can keep track of webhooks that completely fail (to enable alerts and/or manual replays).
* Processing of webhooks should include retries with backoff, up to a capped number of retries.
* Auditing:
  * Should probably reuse the existing `AuditEvent`.
    * The issue here is that the current `AuditEvent` storage table keys do not enable filtering by type, which would make extracting audit events for just webhooks problematic, ineffient, and possibly costly.
    * **We should change the `AuditEvent` storage keys** to the following to enable optimal filtering by type and/or time:
      * `PartitionKey`: `EventType`
      * `RowKey`: `{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd}_EventId`
  * After calling a webhook URL, log an `AuditEvent` on success or failure.
* Job Created Scenarios:
  * When a **Job is created** and the Custodian of the Job has a `Job Created` subscription,  
    Then the Custodian organisation should receive the notification on their Job Created webhook URL.
* Search Updated Scenarios:
  * When a **Search completes/expires/fails** and the initiating Searcher has a `Search Updated` subscription,  
    Then the Searching organisation should receive the notification on their Search Updated webhook URL,  
    And the notification should include the current `Status`, the `WorkItemId`, and current percentage complete.
  * When a **Search is updated on some interval** and the initiating Searcher has a `Search Updated` subscription,  
    Then the Searching organisation should receive the notification on their Search Updated webhook URL,  
    And the notification should include the Status as being `Running`, the `WorkItemId`, and current percentage complete.
      * The **interval** should probably be a configurable time-based interval, e.g. report progress every 5 seconds.

## Related Changes

### Stub Custodians: Webhook rather than Poll for Jobs
* For our mock Custodians that have `Job Created` subscriptions they should not poll for Jobs (disable/exclude applicable Custodian workers), and instead we should have an HTTP endpoint for the `Job Created` webhook's destination.

### E2E Tests: Webhook rather than Poll for Search completion
* For our mock Searchers that have `Search Updated` subscriptions, the E2E Test logic should listen rather than poll for search results, for those applicable subscriptions.
* HTTP Streaming Idea:
  1. The Stub Custodians has an HTTP endpoint for the `Search Updated` webhook's destination.
  2. The Stub Custodians has an HTTP Streaming endpoint (Server-Sent Events, SSE, `text/event-stream`):
      * The streaming endpoint accepts the `WorkItemId` as a param, and should stream out any `Search Updated` events (received by the 'Search Updated Webhook' above) for that specified work item.
  3. The E2E Test logic listens to the HTTP Stream endpoint, rather than polling for search results, for those applicable subscriptions.
* The existing Version 2 E2E tests should be expanded to cover a mixture of polling and notifications/webhooks (with a higher ratio of notifications compared to polling).

### UI Test Harness: Webhook rather than Poll for Search completion
* Ideally, the UI Test Harness should be updated so that it uses the `Search Updated` webhook rather than polling for serach results.
  * An issue here is that it will be the same Org Directory that the E2E tests use, so how will the FindAPI know where the callback should go?  Maybe the Org Directory has a whitelist of "Search Updated callback URLs" so that each individual search can choose which callback URL to use.
  * Probably this could be an option when logging in (choices: "Search Updated webhook" or "Poll for Search Results").

## Related Ideas

### Work Item / Job Expiry
* The existing Work Item Expiry Window of 3 days is probably too long.  The default probably makes more sense to be 4 hours.
* Granular Feedback of Search Jobs:
  * Ideally, search results should show which Jobs/Custodians eventually failed to respond within the allowed time window.

### "Health Check" job
* "Health Check" job would enable the SUI System to know which Custodians are listening and responding.
  - Jobs queued by SUI system on a schedule, probably 0-N hours, 0 being off, or an interval of N hours between "Health Check" jobs being queued for each Custodian.
  - This would also require someway of the Custodians replying and the SUI system storing that.
  - Then we could have a dashboard showing which ones are up, with metrics like uptime, response time.
  - This relates closely to Service Metrics / Success Metrics, so this designed should be aligned with that.
* "Health Check" job would also enable Organisations to be able to test polling/webhooks.
  * Question: how would this be invoked? Admin endpoint / concept?
  * Maybe this is a separate "Ping" job?
